  <h2 class="heading-capped">The story</h2>
  <div class="welcome-message">
    <p>
      So you've heard about two guys that cycled continents. Pheng &amp; Matt are from New Zealand and had planned this trip for several years. As a warm up, in 2015 they toured Southeast Asia cycling from Bangkok to Hanoi over 2 months. This experience made them hungry for an even longer, wilder, and  rewarding trip. So you must be filled with questions since you're still here. Let's see if we got the answers.
    </p>

    <h4 class="heading-capped">Where did we go?</h4>
    <p>
      Starting at the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin, we cycled the Silk Road via Central Asia to Iran. After sipping lots of tea in the Middle East we continued through Europe along the Mediterranean to the Portugal's capital Lisbon.
    </p>

    <h4 class="heading-capped">How did we sleepâ€¦ or eat?</h4>
    <p>
      Where possible we used CouchSurfing and WarmShower. Other times we wild camped as our touring bikes carried everything we needed. We tried lots of local food and have adapted our diet and how we cook our meals at the end of each day.
    </p>

    <h4 class="heading-capped">Why not fly?</h4>
    <p>
      Flying to the destination is boring. It's the journey that counts. We enjoyed the daily routine of cycling from one place to another, not knowing where we'll end up. Every day would be different.
    </p>

    <h4 class="heading-capped">When did we start and finish?</h4>
    <p>
      We left New Zealand on the 17th of March 2018. We started pedalling a week after landing in China making our way west. Our budget could've lasted us three to four years, however, due to unforeseen problems we had to end our trip short after 22 months of travel. By December 2019 we reached our final destination.
