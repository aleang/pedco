        All in all, we cycled through 19 countries in just under
        <span class="stick-label"><span class="days">22</span>months</span>.
        There were several occasions we couldn't cycle (train, boat and police van)
        but approximately 95% of our route was done by pushing those pedals.
        Our Silk Road tour was split into four sections: 
        <span class="fave-place">China</span>
        <span class="fave-place">Central Asia</span>
        <span class="fave-place">Middle East</span>
        <span class="fave-place">Europe</span>
    </p>

<div *ngIf="country">
    <h3>{{country.name}}</h3>
    <p>
        We cycled about around
        <code class="distance" *ngFor="let i of (country.distanceCycled+'KM').split('')">{{i}}</code> 
        for <span class="stick-label">
                <span class="days">{{country.daysCycled}}</span>
                days
            </span>.      
        <span *ngIf="country.favouritePlace">
            Both of us picked 
            <span class="fave-place">{{country.favouritePlace}}</span>
            as our favourite place. 
        </span>
        We spent on average around
        <span class="money stick-label">{{country.averageDailySpend | number:'1.2-2'}}</span>
        a day.
