        All in all, we cycled through 19 countries in just under
        <span class="stick-label"><span class="days">22</span>months</span>.
        There were several occasions we couldn't cycle (train, boat and police van)
        but approximately 95% of our route was done by pushing those pedals.
        Our Silk Road tour was split into four sections: 
        <span class="fave-place">China</span>
        <span class="fave-place">Central Asia</span>
        <span class="fave-place">Middle East</span>
        <span class="fave-place">Europe</span>

        We spent on average around
